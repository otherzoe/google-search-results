# Hi there!

This is a recreation of Google's search result page as a part of The Odin Project. I already had some basic familiarity with semantic HTML prior to this project as well as oodles of vanilla CSS work, so I decided to take the opportunity to showcase my skills and (I hope!) my sense of humor.
